# Food Detection Model

This repository contains models for food detection. The models are trained to identify various types of food in images with high accuracy.

## Models

- **model2.h5**: This model is designed for [specific purpose if known].
- **model_deteksi_makanan_5c_v3_88_37_86_68.h5**: This model is trained to detect food items with an accuracy of 88.37% and a loss of 86.68.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive development)

You can install the required packages using pip:

```sh
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-detection-model.git
    cd food-detection-model
    ```

2. Place the model files (`model2.h5` and `model_deteksi_makanan_5c_v3_88_37_86_68.h5`) in the repository directory.

### Usage

Here is an example of how to load and use the models to make predictions:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the model
model = load_model('model_deteksi_makanan_5c_v3_88_37_86_68.h5')

# Load and preprocess an image
def load_and_preprocess_image(image_path):
    img = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img)
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)
    img_array /= 255.0  # Normalize the image
    return img_array

image_path = 'path_to_your_image.jpg'
image = load_and_preprocess_image(image_path)

# Make a prediction
predictions = model.predict(image)
predicted_class = np.argmax(predictions, axis=1)

# Display the image and prediction
plt.imshow(tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(image_path))
plt.title(f'Predicted class: {predicted_class}')
plt.show()
```

### Training

If you want to train the model from scratch, you can follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset.
2. Define your model architecture.
3. Train the model using the prepared dataset.

Example training script:

```python
# Example of defining and training a simple model
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Define the model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(224, 224, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Prepare data generators
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=0.2)
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory('path_to_train_data', target_size=(224, 224), batch_size=32, class_mode='categorical')

# Train the model
model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10, steps_per_epoch=100)
```
